JOBS TO DO
==========

1.	Amending invoices May 2020
	When a customer provides vouchers late we have to assign them to their account then regenerate the affected invoices, 
	effectively applying the vouchers credits to the invoice. This process appears to have some flaws:-
	
		1. The nominal items do not appear to get updated to match the revised figures.
		2. The transaction total sometimes appear higher than it should be.

2.	Supplier Transactions June 2020
	The transaction analysis needs a simplified list of nominal codes to select from. Too many errors creep in here with items being allocated to the wrong code.
	e.g. Prima Bakeries only needs the "Bread & Cakes" option. Smiths only needs the news options, etc.
	

3.	EPOS Supplier transactions Jan 2021
	Supplier account id not being stored in accID field.
	
	An alternative field is required to store the supplier ID. The accID field store the EPOS_Account ID which is a different table.
	
	Add eiSuppID to tblepos_items table related to accID in tblAccounts.
	

4.	EPOS - Pricemark flag not set correctly. Feb 2021
	This is due to Booker changing their product list report and removing the flag.


5.	News Charging
	Qty and price fields need changing to properly reflect stock quantities.

6.	28/04/2021 - Restriction reminders for the following:-
	Alcohol
	Tobacco
	Lottery
	Medicines

7.	EPOS Deals
	If our price is higher than the retail price, make sure a half price deal works out the difference correctly to avoid corrupting the balance written to the transaction.
